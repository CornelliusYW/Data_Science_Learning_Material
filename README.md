This is github repositories for all data science materials I feel important. All the material are categorized by the contents. 
Feel free to pull and fork the material for your own learning!

I am also writing a lot about data science, you could visit the article on my other [Repo](https://github.com/cornelliusyudhawijaya/Data-Science-Article).

If you feel the material helpful to you, maybe **bought me a cup of coffee?** Thank you!
